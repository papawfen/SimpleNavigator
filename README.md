# SimpleNavigator

Implementation of the Simple Navigator project.

## Task

Within this task, all graphs must meet the following requirements:
- Edge weights are only natural numbers
- There may be loops
- Weights may differ on all edges
- Only a nonzero connected graph

## Part 1. Depth- and Breadth-first search 

Implementation of the graph.h_  library:  
* The library must be developed in C++ language of C++17 standard
* The library code must be located in the src folder in the develop branch  
* When writing code it is necessary to follow the Google style
* Make it as a static library (with the graph.h_ header file)
* The library must be represented as a `Graph` class that stores information about the graph using an **adjacency matrix**. The dimensionality of the adjacency matrix should be set dynamically when initializing the graph (when loading it from a file)
* The program must be built with Makefile which contains standard set of targets for GNU-programs: _all, clean, test, graph.a_
*Prepare full coverage of the `Graph` class methods with unit-tests
* The class `Graph` must contain at least the following public methods:
    + `loadGraphFromFile(string filename)` - loading a graph from a file in the adjacency matrix format
    + `exportGraphToDot(string filename)`- exporting a graph to a dot file (see materials)

Implementation of the graph_algorithms.h_ library:  
* The library must be developed in C++ language of C++17 standard
* The library code must be located in the src folder in the develop branch  
* Make it as a static library (with the graph_algorithms.h_ header file)
* The library must be represented as a ` GraphAlgorithms ` class that stores the implementation of algorithms on graphs. The class `GraphAlgorithms` itself must not know anything about the internal representation of the graph from the class `Graph`. To interact with graph data, the class `GraphAlgorithms` can only use the public methods and properties provided by the `Graph` class. 
* Add to the Makefile graph_algorithms.a_ target 
*Prepare full coverage of the `GraphAlgorithms` class methods with unit-tests
* The class ` GraphAlgorithms ` must contain at least the following public methods:
    + `depthFirstSearch(Graph &graph, int startVertex)` - a *non-recursive* depth-first search in the graph from a given vertex. The function should return an array that contains the traversed vertices in the order they were traversed. When implementing this function, you must use the *self-written* data structure **stack**, which should be previously made as a separate static library
    + `breadthFirstSearch(Graph &graph, int startVertex)` - breadth-first search in the graph from a given vertex. The function should return an array that contains the traversed vertices in the order they were traversed. When implementing this function, you must use the *self-written* data structure **queue**, which should be previously made as a separate static library
* It is necessary to use *self-written* helper classes `Stack` and `Queue` (you can reuse your solution from the *CPP2* project for this). These classes must contain the following methods:
    + `init()` - creating an empty stack/queue
    + `push(value)` - adding an element to the stack/queue
    + `pop()` - getting an element from the stack/queue followed by its removal from the stack/queue
    + `peek()` - getting an element from the stack/queue without its removal from the stack/queue

*In this and the following tasks, consider that the vertex numbers start from 1*

## Part 2. Finding the shortest paths in a graph

* Add two new methods to the `GraphAlgorithms` class:
    + `getShortestPathBetweenVertices(Graph &graph, int vertex1, int vertex2)` - searching for the shortest path between two vertices in a graph using *Dijkstra's algorithm*. The function accepts as input the numbers of two vertices and returns a numerical result equal to the smallest distance between them
    + `getShortestPathsBetweenAllVertices(Graph &graph)` - searching for the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices in a graph using the *Floyd-Warshall algorithm*. As a result, the function returns the matrix of the shortest paths between all vertices of the graph

## Part 3. Finding the minimum spanning tree

* Add a new method to the `GraphAlgorithms` class:
    + `getLeastSpanningTree(Graph &graph)` - searching for the minimal spanning tree in a graph using *Prim's algorithm*. As a result, the function should return the adjacency matrix for the minimal spanning tree

## Part 4. Travelling salesman problem

* Add a new method to the `GraphAlgorithms` class:
    + `solveTravelingSalesmanProblem(Graph &graph)` - solving the traveling salesman's problem using the *ant colony algorithm*.
You need to find the shortest path that goes through all vertices of the graph at least once, followed by a return to the original vertex. As a result, the function should return the `TsmResult` structure described below:
    ```cpp
    struct TsmResult {
        int* vertices;    // an array with the route you are looking for (with the vertex traverse order). Instead of int* you can use std::vector<int>
        double distance;  // the length of this route
    }
    ``` 

*If it is impossible to solve the problem with a given graph, output an error.*

## Part 5. Console interface

* You need to write the main program, which is a console application for testing the functionality of the implemented s21_graph.h and s21_graph_algorithms.h libraries 
* The console interface must provide the following functionality:
    1. loading the original graph from a file
    2. graph traversal in breadth with output of the result to the console   
    3. graph traversal in depth with output of the result to the console
    4. searching for the shortest path between any two vertices and displaying the result to the console
    5. searching for the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices in the graph with the output of the resulting matrix to the console
    6. searching for the minimal spanning tree in the graph with the output of the resulting adjacency matrix to the console
    7. solving the salesman problem with the output of the resulting route and its length to the console
